# BRing
The Broadcasting Ring - BRing for short, is a visualisation of a chronological subset of the television broadcast data archive. It attempts to clearly demonstrate to the viewer which shows have been broadcast over the years in a creative and visually distinct manner.

Two precompileddata sets have been created for use in demonstrating the Proof of Concept of this application. For those on laptops or less powerful machines, please download and view the Fast version.
The intended method of view is via the Full demonstration, which displays a large sample size over a span of 24 years. This version has the greatest variance in content per year, and the results are more visually impressive.
